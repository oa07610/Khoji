# Khoji

A university project for the course Data Structures and Algorithms. Khoji is a navigating app for the local context. We mapped all the local locations which aren't on the map already such as fruit stalls, street food vendors, mechanics and other trivial stalls in the street etc in the 500m radius of Habib University.

Our app calculates the shortest distance and directions to reach from any of these points to any other point. On the backend, we have utilised graphs making every location a node. We utlise djikstra and BFS to give the directions.

All the implementation is done on Python and the Front end is made using Tkinter library in Python.
